# Siege  
*Siege a simple game so that I can learn to make scalable servers, and cloud infrastructure*  

---
## Gameplay
Thousands of players can concurrently play _Siege_, coloring a cell in a grid-like structure, to achieve a certain objective. The gameplay itself is irrelevant for now, but the point is that with thousands of players who may play concurrently, concurrent server request handling, proper network traffic management etc.,  are of utmost importance. 

##  Goals & Learning Outcomes  
Through this project, I aim to:  
- Gain experience **building concurrent servers in Go** that can **handle large traffic**  
- Learn **cloud infra tools**  (specifically **Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD** platforms).  
- Understand performance tradeoffs, bottlenecks, and optimizations in real-world systems.
- Use **Redis** for real-time messaging across distributed servers.  
- Model and manage game state with **PostgreSQL**.
